# joint-tracking
<p>This project’s objective was to discover, test and implement skeletal tracking algorithm, using Intel’s R200 RealSense Camera.</p>

<p>Project to a certain extent implements algorithms using existing Skeletal Tracking Algorithm (Intel RealSense SDK) with 6 body joint points (hands, shoulders, head and spine-mid), send them to a TCP port via socket, as well as render the result with the help of OpenGL.</p>
